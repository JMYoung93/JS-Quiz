# JS-Quiz
## Description
This is a timed quiz that will deduct 5 seconds for every incorrect answer selected. The user will have 60 seconds to answer 5 questions related to coding. This was especially difficult to code from the ground up because there are so many examples of source-code for various types of quizzes and timer functions that it became easy to get lost in trying different tactics. After working with my tutor and classmates, I was able to piece together this final result that performed the tasks assigned.
